### Analysis:
- **Strengths**: The documentation now covers the "Why" (Architecture/ADR), the "How" (Infra/Backend), and the "What If" (Runbooks). The API crisis is documented and prioritized.
- **Opportunities**: Adding ADRs for historical changes and formalizing compliance documents will bring the score to 95%+.
